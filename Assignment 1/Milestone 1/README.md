## Part 2: Effort expended

In order to complete this milestone, we completed the following steps:

### Set up local VM using VirtualBox

1. Set up shared folder on local machine
2. Downloaded/installed VirtualBox
2. Downloaded Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
3. Created and configured a new Virtual Box VM
4. Installed and configured Ubuntu 20.04 LTS from downloaded ISO as guest OS
5. Installed packages required for Guest Additions
6. Installed Guest Additions
7. Enabled access to shared folder on guest OS
8. Disabled password requirement for `sudo` command
9. Installed additional useful packages (e.g. `pip3`, `emacs`)
4. Ran `python3 --version` to confirm it was installed with Ubuntu 20.04

### Set up Instance in Chameleon Cloud

1. Generated key pair and saved private key locally (we were not using
Windows, so we did not need to install/configure PuTTY)
2. Set up an Instance in Chameleon Cloud, including selecting source, flavor,
network, security group(s), and associating our key pairs and floating IPs,
among other steps
3. Discovered Instancce name and confirmed it is accessible via `ssh` on local
VM
4. Ran `python3 --version` to confirm it was installed with Ubuntu 20.04

### Clone scaffolding code and install packages on local VM

1. Cloned
[Programming Assignment Scaffolding Code](https://github.com/asgokhale/CloudComputingCourse)
2. Discovered additional packages needed to run producer code (`kafka`) and
installed with `pip3` (which was installed in the final step of
[section 1 above](#local-vm-setup-using-virtualbox))

## Part 3: Video demo

The following are video walkthroughs of the resources we created and the
packages we installed to complete this milestone:
